The python file wifi_reset.py checks whether internet is working (by pinging Google.com in this case, change as you see fit)
and resets wifi if its not. This fixes the weird internet connectivity issue on the new Windows 10 update (1803 and up) on 
intel and broadcom wifi chipsets

The python code requires elevated (admin) rights, hence the easiest solution would be to run it through a batch (.bat) file (also as shown)
